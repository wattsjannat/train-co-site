# trAIn — Dashboard & sheet payloads

Exact navigateToSection payloads for journey-dashboard. Fill jobId, title, company, matchScore where indicated.

## Dashboard landing (all entries: first visit, returning, or any time you return to dashboard home)

Always **Dashboard** + **ProfileSheet** with id `profile-home` and `props.dashboardAnchor: true`. The frontend injects candidate name, avatar, and skills from cache — you may omit `name` or use a placeholder; do **not** add GlassmorphicOptions begin-cta bubbles.

```json
{"badge":"trAIn CAREER","title":"Dashboard","subtitle":"Your Profile","generativeSubsections":[{"id":"dashboard","templateId":"Dashboard","props":{}},{"id":"profile-home","templateId":"ProfileSheet","props":{"dashboardAnchor":true}}]}
```

## JobSearchSheet (Job Center UI)

```json
{"badge":"trAIn CAREER","title":"Job Center","subtitle":"Find your next job here","generativeSubsections":[{"id":"dashboard","templateId":"Dashboard","props":{}},{"id":"job-search","templateId":"JobSearchSheet","props":{}}]}
```

Optional props: `activeTab` ("good-fit" | "stretch" | "grow-into"). `showSavedOnly` (boolean): when `true`, opens with the **Saved Jobs** filter on (shortlist only). **Do not** set `showSavedOnly` when navigating from **Find more jobs** or **View all saved jobs** — the user should land on full Job Center (all matches, toggle off).

## JobDetailSheet

```json
{"badge":"trAIn CAREER","title":"Job Detail","subtitle":"<title>","generativeSubsections":[{"id":"dashboard","templateId":"Dashboard","props":{}},{"id":"job-detail","templateId":"JobDetailSheet","props":{"jobId":"<id>","title":"<title>","company":"<company>","fitCategory":"good-fit|stretch|grow-into"}}]}
```

Fill jobId, title, company, fitCategory from signal or cache.

## EligibilitySheet

```json
{"badge":"trAIn CAREER","title":"Eligibility","subtitle":"Am I eligible?","generativeSubsections":[{"id":"dashboard","templateId":"Dashboard","props":{}},{"id":"eligibility","templateId":"EligibilitySheet","props":{"jobId":"<id>","jobTitle":"<title>","company":"<company>","matchScore":"<actual numeric score from cached job, e.g. 82>"}}]}
```

Fill jobId, jobTitle, company, matchScore from cached job.

## CloseGapSheet

```json
{"badge":"trAIn CAREER","title":"Close the Gap","subtitle":"Bridge your skill gaps","generativeSubsections":[{"id":"dashboard","templateId":"Dashboard","props":{}},{"id":"close-gap","templateId":"CloseGapSheet","props":{"jobId":"<id>","jobTitle":"<title>","company":"<company>"}}]}
```

## JobApplicationsSheet

```json
{"badge":"trAIn CAREER","title":"Applications","subtitle":"Track your progress","generativeSubsections":[{"id":"dashboard","templateId":"Dashboard","props":{}},{"id":"applications","templateId":"JobApplicationsSheet","props":{}}]}
```

## SavedJobsStack (Profile → Saved Jobs)

Compose with **Dashboard**. **Required:** `bubbles` — same shape as **GlassmorphicOptions** (`label`, optional `value`, `variant` `"default"|"green"`, optional `showArrow`). Labels are **not** hardcoded in the app; copy this JSON verbatim from search (or update here when product changes). Three frontend-mocked jobs are used when `jobs` is omitted.

```json
{"badge":"trAIn CAREER","title":"Saved Jobs","subtitle":"Your shortlist","generativeSubsections":[{"id":"dashboard","templateId":"Dashboard","props":{}},{"id":"saved-jobs","templateId":"SavedJobsStack","props":{"bubbles":[{"label":"View full posting","variant":"default"},{"label":"Am I eligible?","variant":"green","showArrow":true},{"label":"Find more jobs","variant":"default"},{"label":"View all saved jobs","variant":"default"}]}}]}
```

**Do not** call `navigateToSection` without `bubbles` — DynamicSectionLoader will request a correction (same pattern as greeting **GlassmorphicOptions**).

## PastApplicationsSheet

```json
{"badge":"trAIn CAREER","title":"Past Applications","subtitle":"Previous outcomes","generativeSubsections":[{"id":"dashboard","templateId":"Dashboard","props":{}},{"id":"past-apps","templateId":"PastApplicationsSheet","props":{}}]}
```

## SkillsDetail (for "Skill Coverage" from ProfileSheet — NOT SkillCoverageSheet)

From ProfileSheet, ALWAYS navigate to SkillsDetail. NEVER navigate to SkillCoverageSheet directly — it is a child view inside SkillsDetail.

```json
{"badge":"trAIn CAREER","title":"Dashboard","subtitle":"Your skills overview","generativeSubsections":[{"id":"dashboard","templateId":"Dashboard","props":{}},{"id":"skills-detail","templateId":"SkillsDetail","props":{}}]}
```

Frontend auto-injects skill data from cache. "View Skill Coverage →" inside SkillsDetail opens SkillCoverageSheet locally (no AI navigation needed).

## MarketRelevanceDetail (for "Market Relevance" from ProfileSheet — NOT MarketRelevanceSheet)

From ProfileSheet, navigate to MarketRelevanceDetail with bubbles. Widget 1 shows gauge + insight + 2 bubble options initially. User selects bubble to navigate or toggle widget.

```json
{"badge":"trAIn CAREER","title":"Dashboard","subtitle":"Your market relevance","generativeSubsections":[{"id":"dashboard","templateId":"Dashboard","props":{}},{"id":"market-relevance-detail","templateId":"MarketRelevanceDetail","props":{"bubbles":[{"label":"View Market Relevance","variant":"green","showArrow":true},{"label":"Where to Invest Your Time","variant":"default"}]}}]}
```

Frontend auto-injects market relevance data from cache. Bubbles handle navigation: "View Market Relevance" → MarketRelevanceSheet (AI navigates), "Where to Invest Your Time" → widget 2 locally (no navigation).

## CareerGrowthDetail (for "Career Growth" from ProfileSheet — NOT CareerGrowthSheet)

From ProfileSheet, ALWAYS navigate to CareerGrowthDetail. NEVER navigate to CareerGrowthSheet directly — it is a child view inside CareerGrowthDetail.

```json
{"badge":"trAIn CAREER","title":"Dashboard","subtitle":"Your career growth","generativeSubsections":[{"id":"dashboard","templateId":"Dashboard","props":{}},{"id":"career-growth-detail","templateId":"CareerGrowthDetail","props":{}}]}
```

Frontend auto-injects career growth data from cache. "View Career Growth Details →" inside CareerGrowthDetail opens CareerGrowthSheet locally (no AI navigation needed).

## TargetRoleSheet (for "Target Role" from ProfileSheet)

Navigate to TargetRoleSheet when the user clicks the target role tile or says "target role", "view target role", "my target role", etc.

```json
{"badge":"trAIn CAREER","title":"Target Role","subtitle":"Your target role breakdown","generativeSubsections":[{"id":"dashboard","templateId":"Dashboard","props":{}},{"id":"target-role","templateId":"TargetRoleSheet","props":{}}]}
```

Frontend auto-injects skill and role data from cache.

## MyLearningSheet (for "My Learning" button)

Navigate to MyLearningSheet when the user clicks the learning button or says "my learning", "show my learning", etc.

```json
{"badge":"trAIn CAREER","title":"My Learning","subtitle":"Your courses and lessons","generativeSubsections":[{"id":"dashboard","templateId":"Dashboard","props":{}},{"id":"my-learning","templateId":"MyLearningSheet","props":{}}]}
```
