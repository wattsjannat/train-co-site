 * (e.g. "ready to show you" for step 8), a hidden nudge is sent to unblock it.
 * This is the key mechanism that drives the step 7 → step 8 (CardStack)
 * transition: EmptyScreen renders after "Looks Good", the nudge fires, and the
 * AI generates the CardStack response without waiting for a user signal.
